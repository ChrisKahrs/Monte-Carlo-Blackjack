    "`Q`, or the Q-table, is a 2-D list in which the rows are the different possible states and the columns are the different possible actions for each state. The values stores in each cell refer to the value, or Q-value, of selecting some action (the column index) given some state (the row index). These Q-values start at 0 for every state-action pair, and are updated by the update_Q() function after each episode to reflect the rewards received in an episode where the state-action pair occured. All Q-values initially start at 0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "`prob`, or the prob table, has the same structure as `Q`, but the cell values refer to the probability of selecting some action (the column index) given some state (the row index). These probabilities are updated by the update_prob() function after the Q-values are updated after each episode. All action probabilties start at 0.5 (or 50%).  \n",
    "\n",
    "`alpha` defines the weight given to each new change in Q-value within the update_Q() function. A smaller `alpha` means that a new reward logged in an episode for some state-action pair has less impact on the current Q-value for that state-action pair. The converse is also true. Therefore, `alpha` essentially defines how fast the AI agent learns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "`epsilon` defines the weight given to each new change in the action probabilities within the update_prob() function. A larger `epsilon` reduces the % amount by which an action probability is changed after some changes in Q-values. The converse is also true. An `epsilon` of 1 means that no change will occur in the action probability, regardless of the magnitude of changes in Q-values.  \n",

Since a round (or episode) of Blackjack can have more than 1 decision made, there can be numerous state-action pairs that are seen in one episode. However, only the final decision (or state-action pair) yields an immediate reward from the environment. All previous state-action pairs had no rewards. So, the final reward must be used to modify the Q-values of the earlier state-action pairs. Since the final reward was only partially made possible by the earlier state-action pairs, the final reward is discounted using `gamma` to account for this.  \n",

    "In each episode, `epsilon` is first decayed by the `decay` rate.  \n",

    "Then, the game of Blackjack is played out through the `play_game()` function. This function returns a list of the state-action-reward tuples that occured during the game. These tuples represent the actions the AI agent had to take given some state, and the rewards that resulted.  \n",
